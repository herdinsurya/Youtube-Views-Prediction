<h1 align="center">Youtube Views Prediction</h1>

## Objectives
Build model to predict video views based on statistical numbers and other attributes.

## About Dataset
This dataset is obtained from [Trending YouTube Video Statistics | Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new)

## Main Instructions
1. Exploratory analysis from the data, create some visualization to describe the data
2. Describe the pre-processing steps, also the reason behind them
3. Split the data into training and testing with optional portion
4. Build the models with matching hyperparameter tune, choose the best model, also the reason behind that
5. Test the model with data test

# Requirements
1. Jupyter Notebook
2. Web browser (Chrome)

# Conclusion
**Based on the experiments that have been carried out, there are several models that are good for determining the views of Youtube videos** </br>
**1. Random Forest with MAE 0.00, RMSE 0.01, and R2 of 0.96 makes Random Forest the best model so far**</br>
**2. Decision Tree is the second best sequence model after Random Forest with a slightly smaller R2 value of 0.92**</br>
**3. Elastic Net is the third best model with MAE 0.01, RMSE 0.01, and R2 0.80 values** </br>
**4. Ridge Regularization is the next best model with MAE values of 0.01, RMSE 0.01, and R2 of 0.79**</br>
**5. a very influential feature is the number of likes and dislikes of a video**
